Follow through of the Front End Master course 'ES6: The Right Parts' by Kyle Simpson

following this tutorial in efforts to increase my depth of knowledge using both JavaScript and especially the changes brought about in ES6.

My goal is to take this learning forward in my everyday coding and write code that takes advantage of the features provided by ES6 in Javascript. I am also hoping this knowledge will help keep me up to date with the changing technologies and make reading other online tutorials/troubleshooting posts easier.
